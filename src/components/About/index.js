      <p>
        Hi!  My name is Will and I'm a budding Full-Stack web developer.  Welcome to my Portfolio, built using React!
        <br/><br/>
        I've built a number of applications, some of which are showcased here on this page.  
        If you want to check out what I've made please click the "Portfolio" option in the Navigation bar above.  
        My other work can be found on my GitHub profile linked below in the Footer and in the "Contact" section, where you can also send me an email.  
        Some of the useful skills and technologies I'm proficient in are listed in under the "Resume" section of this page, as well as a downloadable copy of my resume.
        <br/><br/>
        Outside of web development, I love to play disc golf in my spare time.  It's a nice change of pace from typing away at a keyboard all day :).
        I hope you enjoy your time exploring my portfolio and if you need to contact me for anything or just want to chat, please reach out!
